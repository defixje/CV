As a developer I strive to create the best solutions for the challenges I encounter. I am a team-player and loyal to my clients. I learned how to break down projects in smaller segments using the SCRUM project management-method and I like to think outside the box. My programming languages of choice are PHP7 (OO), ES6. I am not afraid of difficult problems and I don't have a nine-to-five mentality. In my professional career I seek the fulfillment of gaining more knowledge and creating elegant solutions for difficult problems. With over 10 years of experience in backend/infrastructure and (web-)development I can be a strong asset to your company.
